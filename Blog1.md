# Today we learned about variables/data types/operators/conditions

## Variables are a way to assign a value to a key
## name = "ian"   - name now holds the value of "ian:

## data types include strings/integers/floats/booleans
## strings - any group of characters surrounded by quotation marks
## integers = negative or positive whole numbers 
## floats - numbers with a decimal
## booleans - true or false

## operators compare values - compare all data types to see if true or false
## conditional statements check to see IF something is true or false and then executes a code block

### examples: 
### if 30 > 5:
###     print("Hello")  ---- prints Hello
